# Debian Dotfiles
The point of this repo is to manage the dotfiles on each debian based machine easily.
Additionally there is a script (or set of scripts) that will automate any setup necessary to get a machine rolling in as few commands as possible.

## Installation 
```cd ~/
git init
git remote add origin 
git pull origin master
~/.config/setup.py```
